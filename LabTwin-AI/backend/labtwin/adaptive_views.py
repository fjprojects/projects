Generate ONE NEW adaptive programming lab question.

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE:

{language}

EXACT SELECTED SYLLABUS TOPIC:

{topics[0] if topics else ""}

THIS IS THE ONLY ALLOWED TOPIC FOR THIS QUESTION.

The programming problem must primarily test this exact topic.
Do not use another syllabus topic as the main skill.

PREVIOUS QUESTIONS:

{json.dumps(previous_questions, indent=2)}

{weakness_instruction}

{language_rules}

STRICT RULES:

1. Stay strictly inside the uploaded syllabus.
2. Use exactly the detected programming language: {language}.
3. The question must DIRECTLY test "{topics[0] if topics else ""}".
3A. "{topics[0] if topics else ""}" must be the PRIMARY SKILL required to solve the problem, not merely something that appears incidentally in the code.
3B. The returned "topic" field MUST exactly equal "{topics[0] if topics else ""}".
3B. Example: Java Program Structure must test class Main, main method/entry point/imports/program layout. Do NOT label a conditionals, switch, loops, arrays, or short-circuiting problem as Java Program Structure.
4. Never create a "{language} adaptation" of a concept from
   another programming language.
5. Never replace a language-specific concept with a loosely
   related concept.
6. Do not repeat previous questions.
7. Keep the question appropriate for a college programming lab.
8. Generate exactly THREE deterministic hidden test cases.
9. Hidden tests must match the exact stated question.
10. Avoid file-based questions for automatic execution unless
    deterministic stdin/stdout testing is possible.

concept_key must be one of:

ARITHMETIC_OPERATORS

CONDITIONALS
LOOPS

FUNCTIONS
